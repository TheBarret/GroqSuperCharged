# Groq Super Charged
Agent-Based Approach with Modular Roles

This script employs an agent-based approach to problem-solving, utilizing modular roles to enhance collaborative efforts towards a common goal. Each agent assumes a specific sub-role, contributing uniquely to the overall task. The process involves:

1. **Analyst**: Analyzes requirements and drafts an initial solution.
2. **Reviewer**: Reviews the draft for quality, readability, and coherence.
3. **Developer**: Refines and completes the solution based on the review.
4. **Manager**: Summarizes and explains the final solution.

The system leverages the Groq API for generating responses, ensuring a structured and efficient workflow.

`python main.py 'Generate a python function that explores the optimized primality tests and more efficient algorithms for generating prime numbers.'`
